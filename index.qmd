In this project we aim to visualize the trends of the most frequently used babynames from 1880 to 2017 in the United States. We do this by:

- Understanding the different columns of the data set
- Find the top 10 most frequently used baby names in the data for:
  - girls
  - boys
- Plot the yearly trend of the top 10 baby names
